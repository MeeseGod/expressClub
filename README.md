##  The Underground
This application is a live chat application with user registration, administration capabilities and anonymity protection for users from non-verified users. 

The application utilizes express as it's backend and EJS for it's view. 

Live App: https://the-underground.onrender.com/

Note! Render shuts down services when an web service has been flagged as inactive for more than 15 minutes. Give the page a moment to load if this is the case. The live app is meant to be a demo, not a 24/7 service.
