## Express Club
This application was created for the Odin Project as part of it's express curriculum.
The point of the application is to create a message board that allows user registration and displays posts accordingly.
Users who are logged in are able to see the user information, such as usernames, of other users who post.
Anonymous viewers however will only see anonymous information, keeping user information private.

Live App: https://the-underground.onrender.com/
Note! Render shuts down services when an web service has been flagged as inactive for more than 15 minutes. Give the page a moment to load if this is the case. The live app is meant to be a demo, not a 24/7 service.
